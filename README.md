# URL_SHORTENER
ðŸš€ Thrilled to share my latest project: 'URLSHORTENER'! ðŸ”— A tool to simplify URL management by creating shortened links. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:

Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Postman
Functionality:
Generates a short, unique ID for URLs.
Shortened URLs redirect users to the original destination.
Backend:
Utilizes Node.js and Express.js for routing and middleware.
MongoDB for storing original URLs and their corresponding short IDs.
Routes:
POST /url to shorten URLs.
GET /url/
to redirect using the short ID.
Learning Outcomes:
Running and managing a Node.js server.
Optimizing code with the Express framework.
Setting up MongoDB, creating collections, and storing data.
Using Postman to test backend APIs effectively without a UI.
Goal: Streamlining the process of URL shortening and redirection with efficient backend handling.
